# QuakerMan
QuakerMan is a tweet scheduling bot that allows you to schedule tweets in advance. In order to use QuakerMan, you will need to have a Twitter Developer account. You can apply for a developer account at https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-twitter-api.

QuakerMan uses Firebase Firestore as a database to store the tweets that you have scheduled. The QuakerMan API offers the following endpoints for interacting with your scheduled tweets:

Once you have set up your database, you can use the following endpoints to interact with the QuakerMan API:

- POST v1/tweets/ - This endpoint allows you to create a new tweet and schedule it for a specific time in the future. The request body should include the text of the tweet and the timestamp for when you want it to be sent. and the isTweeted field will be set to false to indicate that the tweet has not yet been sent.

- GET v1/tweets/ - This endpoint allows you to retrieve all of the tweets that you have scheduled. It will return an object with an items field containing an array of the tweets.

- DELETE v1/tweets/:id - This endpoint allows you to delete a specific tweet that you have scheduled. The id of the tweet to be deleted should be passed as a parameter in the URL. If the id is not provided, the endpoint will return an error.

- PUT v1/tweets/ - This endpoint allows you to update an existing tweet that you have scheduled. The request body should include the updated fields for the tweet.

Once you have all the necessary information you can put them in a .env file in your repo and the example in the repo will guide you
